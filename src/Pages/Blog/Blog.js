                <h5><strong>QN-1: </strong>Difference between`authorization` and`authentication`</h5>
                <p><strong>Ans:</strong>Authentication verifies who the user is and Authorization determines what resources a user can access.
                    Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process and Authorization always takes place after authentication.
                    Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user and Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.
